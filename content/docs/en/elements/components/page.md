`<Page>` is a UI component that represents an application screen. NativeScript apps typically consist of one or more `<Page>` that wrap content such as an [`<ActionBar>`](/en/docs/elements/action-bar/action-bar) and other UI widgets.

---

#### A single page

```html
<Page>
  <ActionBar title="My App" />
  <GridLayout>
    <Label text="My Content"/>
  </GridLayout>
</Page>
```

#### Using the `loaded` event for triggering UI changes

A typical scenario is performing UI changes after the page is loaded. The recommended way to do it is by using the `loaded` event, triggered by NativeScript when the page is fully loaded:

```html
<Page @loaded="greet">
  <ActionBar title="My App" />
  <GridLayout>
    <Label text="My Content"/>
  </GridLayout>
</Page>
```

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    greet() {
      alert('Hello!').then(() => {
        console.log('Dialog closed')
      })
    }
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: Developers coming from a web background would usually reach for the `mounted` lifecycle hook Vue provides, however in NativeScript the application, and certain elements might not yet be loaded when the `mounted` hook is executed, thus certain actions such as alerts, dialogs, navigation etc. are not possible inside the `mounted` hook. To work around this limitation, the `loaded` event may be used, which only fires after the application is ready. In this case, we are using the `loaded` event of the [`<Page>`](/en/docs/elements/components/page) element, but this event is available for all NativeScript elements.
