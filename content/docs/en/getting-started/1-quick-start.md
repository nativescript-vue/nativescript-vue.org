If you don't want the hassle of installing and configuring your system before you can have a taste of NativeScript + Vue.js development, the [NativeScript Playground](/en/docs/getting-started/playground-tutorial) has you covered.

But if [you already have your system ready for native development](/en/docs/getting-started/installation), you can start by using a template:

```shell
$ npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-init
$ vue init nativescript-vue/vue-cli-template <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ npm install
```

Next, run your app using:

```shell
$ npm run watch:<platform>
```

where platform is `ios` or `android`.

For more information about the available templates, see the [templates documentation](/en/docs/getting-started/templates).
