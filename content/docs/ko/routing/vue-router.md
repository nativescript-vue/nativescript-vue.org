If [Manual Routing](/en/docs/routing/manual-routing) doesn't cut it for your use-case,
then you'll be happy to learn [the Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) is fully supported.

## Installation
From a command prompt, run:
```bash
npm i vue-router --save
```

## Usage
Let's show a full example, broken down in a few pieces so we can provide some comments.
Note that the Vue Router has more tricks up its sleeve, so be sure to visit
[the official documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

---
Require Vue, VueRouter, and let them shake hands ü§ù
```js
const Vue = require('nativescript-vue');
const VueRouter = require('vue-router');

Vue.use(VueRouter);
```

---
Define a `Master` page with the current router as its title (`$route.path`)
and a button with a `@tap="$router.push('/detail')"` so a new page is pushed on the stack and navigated to.

Also, a button to the same page with a query param `user`.
```html
const Master = {
  template: `
    <Page>
      <ActionBar :title="$route.path" />
      <StackLayout>
        <Button text="To Details" @tap="$router.push('/detail')" />
        <Button text="To Details (with query param)" @tap="$router.push('/detail?user=John+Appleseed')"></Button>
      </StackLayout>
    </Page>
  `
};
```

---
Define a `Detail` page with a `NavigationButton`. On iOS this will automatically bring you back to the
previous page in the stack, but for Android `tap` handler is required (which is ignored on iOS).
So add `@tap="$router.back()"`.

Remember that `user` query param we passed from the second button of the `Master` page? You can use it in the `Details`
page like this: `<Label :text="$route.query.user">`

Lastly, you can navigate back (and forth) with `$router.go(<number-of-pages>)` as demonstrated below.

```html
const Detail = {
  template: `
    <Page>
      <ActionBar :title="$route.path">
        <NavigationButton text="Back!" android.systemIcon="ic_menu_back" @tap="$router.back()" />
      </ActionBar>
      <StackLayout>
        <Label :text="$route.query.user" v-if="$route.query.user" />
        <Button text="Back to Master" @tap="$router.go(-1)" />
      </StackLayout>
    </Page>
  `
};
```

---
Define all the pages of your application as follows:
```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  pageRouting: true,
  routes: [
    {path: '/master', component: Master},
    {path: '/detail', component: Detail},
    {path: '*', redirect: '/master'}
  ]
});
```

---
And load one of those routes when the app starts:
```js
router.replace('/master');
```

---
Oh, and don't forget to tell `Vue` about your routes:
```js
new Vue({
  router
}).$start();
```
