If you want to easily try NativeScript-Vue, we strongly recommend trying
it in the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org?template=play-vue). It is the easiest introduction you can get into NativeScript-Vue.

If you are ready to move on and work locally on your machine, and [you
have your system ready for native development](/en/docs/getting-started/installation), you can start by using a template:

```shell
$ tns create my-app --template nativescript-vue-template
$ cd my-app
```

and then run your app using:

```shell
$ tns run android # for android
```

```shell
$ tns run ios # for ios
```

To learn more about the available templates head over to the [templates documentation](/en/docs/getting-started/templates).
